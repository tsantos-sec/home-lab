## 🐧 Linux CLI & System Administration
*Core commands for navigating and managing Linux environments.*

* **File Search:** `find / -name filename` - Search for a file from the root directory.
* **Filtering Content:** `grep "pattern" file.txt` - Search for specific strings within a file.
* **Permissions:** `chmod 600 file` - Set read/write permissions for the owner only.
* **View Hidden Strings:** `strings file` - Find human-readable characters inside binary files.
* **Process Management:** `ps aux | grep root` - List all processes running as root.

## 🌐 Networking & Reconnaissance
*Essential tools for analyzing network traffic and host discovery.*

### **Nmap (Network Mapper)**
* `nmap -sV [IP]` - Detect service versions running on open ports.
* `nmap -A [IP]` - Aggressive scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning).
* `nmap -p- [IP]` - Scan all 65,535 ports.

### **Network Analysis**
* **Netcat (nc):** `nc -lvp 4444` - Listen for incoming connections on a specific port.
* **Wireshark/Tshark:** Used for deep packet inspection and analyzing `.pcap` files.
* **IP Configuration:** `ip addr` or `ifconfig` - Check network interface details.

## 🔐 Security & Cryptography
*Commands for encoding, decoding, and handling secure connections.*

* **Base64:** `echo "string" | base64` (encode) | `echo "encoded" | base64 -d` (decode).
* **Hash Identification:** `hashid "hash_string"` - Identify the type of encryption/hash used.
* **SSH Keys:** `ssh -i private_key user@host` - Connect using a private key file.
* **OpenSSL:** `openssl s_client -connect host:port` - Test and debug SSL/TLS connections.

## 🛡️ SOC & Defense Operations (In Progress)
*Methodologies and tools for security analysis.*

* **Log Analysis:** Using `cat`, `awk`, and `cut` to parse web server logs (Apache/Nginx).
* **SIEM Tools:** Practice with **Splunk** and **ELK Stack** for centralized log monitoring.
* **Traffic Analysis:** Detecting suspicious patterns (large data transfers, unusual ports) via Wireshark.
